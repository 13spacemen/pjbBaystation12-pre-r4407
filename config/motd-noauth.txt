Welcome to the server. Have fun!

Check out a wiki (Composed by the goons over on that other server you probably thought of joining.) at http://ss13.donglabs.com

And here is a very useful guide as well, provided by one of our players-

One more, very useful guide, on everything useful, would be this one, made down by the people down in the Penny Arcade forums. Whatever you call them. Arcaders, or whathaveyou.

They have links down at the bottom of the first page to many subjects.

are admins,If we need more/less let me know on the forums. Or if you think you'd be a good admin. I don't care too much.

----------------------------------------------------(>'')>--------------------------------------

Anyway, for the rest of you, here are the rules, even if they are a bit messy.


-If you're by yourself on a server, do whatever you want, but please try not to crash it.

-No flaming, no name calling or stuff like that in OOC. You can say whatever you like IC, provided you have a valid reason and are targeting the character, not the player.

-Try to keep IC chat out of OOC chat, at least until the end of the round. 

-No rasism, sexism please, even IC. It can offend some people, and no one wants that. 

-No griefing on the server please. (Don't kill people randomly, for no reason, and don't purposely ruin the round for people

-Admins, this one if for you. You are NOT god. You are equal to the players who join this game. No not disrespect them, and they won't disrespect you. As am I.

-On that note, do not disrepect anyone, whoever they/you are.

-Do not try to crash the server.

-No multikeying, obviously. (No multiple accounts joining same game.)

-PLEASE try your best to use good english and grammar in IC chat. 

-No OOC in IC chat.

-Do not counter grief with more grief. This makes more paperwork for everyone and no one walks away happy.

-Metagaming (Knowing what you know OOC, and not IC) is not allowed.

All admins reserve the right to ban anyone who is a 'major idiot.' You probably won't know you're an idiot until we tell, you though, so, don't worry about this. Most of you are not, so you can relax. XD   Anyone who disagrees with said judgement, may contact me, 'Johbson' on the BYOND messager, or, on the Bay12 Forums, in which I am 'Dr. Johbson' An example, however, to tell if your an idiot, would be if your annoying/making groups of people angry. Also, please tell us if your new, we'll be a lot less harsh. I also understand that this may be used as an excuse in some bannings. 

------------------------IN CHARACTER RULES, JUNE 30th-------------------------------------------

Ok, so these are the rules to what your character knows, as in, in character.


-You character does not know what 'round' it is, as in, don't prep for blob, even if it told you the gamemode at the begining of the round. Thats OOC knowledge. You get extra points for not knowing fire kills the blob, until you see it happen, or are told. But this doesn't matter. It would make me happy, though.

-During tratior round, you do not know about his radio uplink, even when Cent. Com sends the report. You do, however, know which items are contraband, but that does not mean syndicate right away.

-Red Spacesuits are the symbol of the Syndicate. If you see someone wearing on, you can believe that they are Syndicate, and are here on a sabotage mission.

-You shouldn't know how do things your job's training wouldn't teach. For example, the janitor probably doesn't know how to revive people. Probably. An exception to this would be, if you become a job, and your character does not know what he's doing, you may then choose yourself what he knows. Don't say everything when asked.
------------------WHAT YOUR CHARACTER KNOWS(Lore) JUNE 30th-----------------------------------

-Cent. Com has made 11 previous stations, this is the newest one, a research station.

-Terrforming on other planets have begun.

-Syndicate are very, very bad.

-Wizards and Space zombies are just rumours to scare stupid people, obviously!

-Space Fever is an illness that you get from being in space for an extended period of time. It is VERY contagious. Symtomps include dizziness and fever.


More to come when I am less lazy.

IF YOUR LAZY AND DON'T READ THIS MOTD, I WILL HATE YOU FOREVER!
