22-58:OOC: Cog Awesomeblood/Guest-2854149274 : oh
22-58:OOC: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : use the arrow keys to move around
22-58:OOC: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : and when you&#39;re ready, hit &#34;Character Setup&#34;
22-58:ACCESS: Login: Topkasa from 127.0.0.1
22-58:OOC: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : now, the important thing here
22-58:OOC: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : it in the oocupation choices category
22-58:OOC: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : select the link to set a choice
22-58:OOC: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : and click &#34;Assistant&#34;
22-58:OOC: Cog Awesomeblood/Guest-2854149274 : k
22-58:OOC: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : that way I know where to find you on the station
22-58:OOC: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : once you&#39;re done setup, scroll that pane down and hit &#34;save setup&#34;
22-58:OOC: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : then close the window
22-58:OOC: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : for example, I sved mine so I&#39;m always the same guy every round for consistency
22-58:OOC: Cog Awesomeblood/Guest-2854149274 : ah
22-58:OOC: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : Desmond Taggart
22-58:OOC: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : oh
22-58:OOC: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : and if you get yourself killed
22-58:OOC: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : I have the ability to magically heal you
22-58:OOC: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : lolol, Host-level admin powers
22-58:OOC: Cog Awesomeblood/Guest-2854149274 : lol
22-58:OOC: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : okay, so now, hit the &#34;ready&#34; button in the command pane, where you hit Character Setup
22-58:OOC: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : should be near the bottom
22-58:OOC: Cog Awesomeblood/Guest-2854149274 : aaah

22-58:GAME: starting game of extended
22-58:OOC: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : I&#39;ll come get you
22-58:OOC: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : you got warped to your starting position
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : hi
22-58:OOC: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : okay, so this is the station most gameplay takes place on
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : to talk like I am, just use &#34;say&#34; the same way you were using ooc
22-58:SAY: Cog Awesomeblood/Guest-2854149274 : Oh
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : You&#39;re an assistant right now, which means you get access to almost nowhere
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : so let&#39;s fix that first
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : to open doors
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : walk up to them, and either try to walk through them, or click on them with the left mouse button
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : you wait here,
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : okay, now, item management
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : to, say, take off your Id
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : click on it in the 3x3 blue pane in the bottom
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : that&#39;ll move it to your active hand
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : now, click on the table
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : thanks
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : to put the ID back on
22-58:OOC: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : just click on the place it was
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : not quite
22-58:OOC: Cog Awesomeblood/Guest-2854149274 : derp
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : ah, there
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : also, see the red HAND button to the lower-right center of the hud?
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : that changes which hand you&#39;re trying to use
22-58:SAY: Cog Awesomeblood/Guest-2854149274 : Oh
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : you&#39;ll use that button a lot
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : along the right side of your screen are some blue icons and a temperature gauge
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : you really don&#39;t want those to look any different than they do now
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : because that&#39;s very very bad
22-58:SAY: Cog Awesomeblood/Guest-2854149274 : Naturally
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : O2 is whether you can breathe or not
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : the sparkly one means the air either has cloroform or poison/plasma in it
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : the fire one is obvious
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : the temperature gauge is too
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : if it&#39;s too low or high, you can pass out
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : and drop everything you&#39;re holding
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : the lowest is the most important
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : that&#39;s your overall health
22-58:SAY: Cog Awesomeblood/Guest-2854149274 : I wanna say that blue is good
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : if it goes red, you&#39;re dying
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : if it&#39;s a skeleton, you&#39;re dead
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : blue is best
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : that&#39;s the basic part of it
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : now, you can also use radio communications
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : ;like this
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : to do that
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : prefix anything you want to say over the radio with a semicolon
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : as in say ;test
22-58:SAY: Cog Awesomeblood/Guest-2854149274 : ;Oh
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : you need a radio headset for that to work, though
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : which you have
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : now, if you click on your backpack in the 3x3 there, you can open it and see what&#39;s inside, which for now is just a box
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : some items, like the backpack, can store other smaller items inside
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : here is the bar
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : if there&#39;s a bartender there, you can get durnk
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : Drunk
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : crew quarters
22-58:SAY: Cog Awesomeblood/Guest-2854149274 : I sure hope that was intentional
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : never used
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : I wish it was
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : maintenance corridors.  these let you move around if the halls are blocked
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : they&#39;re also lit poorly
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : also
22-58:SAY: Cog Awesomeblood/Guest-2854149274 : as any maintenance corridor in space should be
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : these are ladders
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : click it, go up or down a floor
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : but
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : they&#39;re new to this codebase (just wrote them this morning) so theyre not used muxh
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : much
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : now
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : these are your best friends
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : internals closets
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : gas mask and oxygen tank
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : let you breathe when there&#39;s no air
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : you can store both in your backpack
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : but if you&#39;re going out near space, it&#39;s generally advised that you put the oxygen tank on your back instead ot hte backpack
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : so if you pass out you don&#39;t drop your tank and then suffocate
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : the red lines are power cables, right now there&#39;s baout 240Kwatts through them
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : I generally bump that up to at least 400kw
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : in any game mode other than extended, there&#39;s usually a point to the round as well
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : so, there&#39;s a ton of stuff to actually do on the round
22-58:SAY: Unknown/Guest-2854149274 : how do I put the oxygen tank on?
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : like run the engine, medical, genetics experimentation
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : okay,
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : drag the backpack into an open hand slot
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : then close the storage popup
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : then set your active hand to the one with the tank, and there you do
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : *go
22-58:SAY: Cog Awesomeblood/Guest-2854149274 : woo
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : but, just having a tank won&#39;t help
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : you have to open the valve on it too
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : to do that
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : bring it into a hand
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : click on it
22-58:SAY: Cog Awesomeblood/Guest-2854149274 : done
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : and click to open the valve
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : the internals thing on your sidebar is now green
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : you&#39;re on your own air supply
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : so the station is fairly detailed
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : we have a full jail and court system
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : firefighting
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : atmospherics control
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : an engine room
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : medical bay
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : plasma and medical research
22-58:SAY: Cog Awesomeblood/Guest-2854149274 : Wow
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : and no ethics to speak of
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : and there&#39;s lots more, too
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : The chapel, crew quarters, security, the AI, the bridge, EVA storage, all the other storages, the supply warehouse
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : centcom
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : lots
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : but the AI is run by a player, so without one it&#39;s offline
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : but right now,
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : ;I need to start the engine
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : welcome to engineering
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : this is the power plant for the station
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : this is the TEG
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : Thermo Electric generator
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : it&#39;s the main power source for the whole station
22-58:SAY: Cog Awesomeblood/Guest-2854149274 : Man, this IS detailed
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : This isn&#39;t the half of it
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : I&#39;m gonna start it, then explain how it works
22-58:SAY: Cog Awesomeblood/Guest-2854149274 : Lemme get my inventory in order
22-58:SAY: Cog Awesomeblood/Guest-2854149274 : Forgot to switch hands
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : okay so
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : right now I&#39;m just hooking up gas canisters
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : to provide fuel for the combustion chamber
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : 2550 AD and all we use is a fucking combustion engine on a space station
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : oh and
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : don&#39;t open valves on the CO2 or plasma canisters
22-58:SAY: Cog Awesomeblood/Guest-2854149274 : ack, I keep getting file download dialogs
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : they&#39;ll kill you right quick
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : o_O
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : you should have only had to get a single dialog from this game
22-58:SAY: Cog Awesomeblood/Guest-2854149274 : It keeps opening blank files
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : okay
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : now, I&#39;ll show you how the engine runs
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : the unit works like a carnot engine
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : one side is connected to the combustion chamber, and gets host
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : hot, rather
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : the other side vents heat to space
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : hot, cold, and the temperature difference is what is used to create the electricity the station equipment uses
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : In this game, we use CO2 as a transfer medium
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : which is what the two blackish canisters hold
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : The TEG has a pair of circulators, which do what they suggest
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : if they weren&#39;t circulating the gases, there&#39;d be no heat exchange
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : fairly detailed.
22-58:SAY: Cog Awesomeblood/Guest-2854149274 : Those are the tiles with blue around them, right?
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : these two things
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : the blue things are windows
22-58:SAY: Cog Awesomeblood/Guest-2854149274 : Oh
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : now, you can see that the TEG has a bar on it
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : that is slowly filling
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : that&#39;s an at-a-glace listing of how much power the TEG is producing
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : click the TEG for a more indepth view
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : we want to be producing about 1.6 million watts
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : it takes about a minute to heat up that much
22-58:SAY: Cog Awesomeblood/Guest-2854149274 : To power the entire station?
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : no, the statio nruns about 260Kws load normally
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : but
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : I like to charge the SMES units at maximum rate
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : and that takes 200Kw each, and 8 SMES units
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : making 1.6Million watts from the teg
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : (incidentally, I made the graphics for the teg)
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : so, this is good
22-58:SAY: Cog Awesomeblood/Guest-2854149274 : Maybe if I stop closing the status window I won&#39;t get the download prompts
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : now for the next step
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : these are the superconducting magnetic enegery storage devices
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : look them up on wikipedia sometime
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : basically, they&#39;re giant batteries
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : they can charge from the energy the TEG puts out
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : and provide power to the station
22-58:ADMIN: Topkasa created /obj/item/weapon/t_scanner
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : you can see how they&#39;re wired here
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : the outer ring wire connects to the TEG
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : and the inner grid is the station&#39;s main supply cable
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : now, for the SMES units along the bottom
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : click on it,
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : with the other hand
22-58:SAY: Cog Awesomeblood/Guest-2854149274 : Aaa
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : then click them to charge automatically
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : and click the right M by charge rate, to set it to maximum charge rate
22-58:SAY: Cog Awesomeblood/Guest-2854149274 : This is getting annoying
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : this way, the SMES units won&#39;t run out of power
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : what is?
22-58:SAY: Cog Awesomeblood/Guest-2854149274 : Mind if I restart the client real quick?
22-58:SAY: Desmond Taggart/Topkasa : yeah, sure
