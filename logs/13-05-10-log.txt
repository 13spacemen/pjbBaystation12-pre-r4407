23-12:OOC: Jane Hammelyn/Ridley4 : Data is probably saying he made it - sure, he likely improved it (and I pray he dealt with the flashbang exploit) but it is nothing new.
23-12:OOC: William Winters/Grakelin : from what I read, it&#39;s supposed to be something like Uplink. Is it all hacking and stuff?

23-12:OOC: Jane Hammelyn/Ridley4 : But Console as I know it was one step away from bare metal.
