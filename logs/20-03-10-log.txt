Lia was the person with the Captain&#39;s ID, I wanted to hold them for security? But they stunned me and i found myself in medbay locked up, I was able to get out... ran for a bit and calmed down.. sat in obs. I should have stayed.. but ai started locking things down and calling Lia&#39;Vael#, i used something the body im space had on it.. found myself in ai upload.. things kinda went crazy then
