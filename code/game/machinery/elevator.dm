Elevator System

Base Design:

* 1x car in shafts, goes up and down in floors.  Crushes people who get stuck or above the car when it
  reaches a terminus if there's isn't room for them
* Supports up to 4 stops per shaft, with stops not necessarily being on connecting floors (1 2 . . 3 . 4)
* Isolated network connected to a control computer somewhere
