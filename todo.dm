/** Things that have to be done:
- either remove /obj/move or update its atmosphere algorithm to the new one
- move some of the direct checks in mob/Life() such as whether the mob is wearing a thermal visor into their own functions,
  so that they can be updated more easily for the different types of mobs
- implement standardized damage functions
- implement damage procs and move all the damage code there

/** Googolplexed TODO
- Fix up centcom gamemode
